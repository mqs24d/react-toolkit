# Collection of react utilities

- createReducer: an adoption of https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit createSlice function for useReducer
- createReducerContext: wraps createReducer into a context
- createSearchParams: heavily inspired by createReducer to handle search/query params
- shallowEquals (copy of redux shallowEqual)
